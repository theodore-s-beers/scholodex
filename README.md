# Scholodex

This is a prototype for a kind of _scholarly rolodex_, developed using the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework with TypeScript.

I wanted something more than a “toy program,” but not by much, to help me get familiar with Svelte. Hence an address book, tailored, in theory, to maintaining a list of academic contacts.
