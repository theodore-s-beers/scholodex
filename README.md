# Scholodex

This is a prototype for a kind of _scholar’s rolodex_, developed using the
[Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) framework (to use the term loosely)
with TypeScript.

I wanted something more than a “toy program,” but not by much, to help me get
familiar with Svelte. Hence an address book, tailored, in theory, to maintaining
a list of academic contacts.
